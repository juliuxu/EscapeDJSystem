# TODO
* Make messages only viewable for the DJ
* Make max number of elements dynamic to fit screen

## Features
* Show what is currently playing (last.fm)

## Bugs
* After fullscreen view on a smaller screen, the menu gets pushed down
* Optimize, runs kinda slow on my kimsufi server... (compared to my laptop)
	- Probably just host on better hardware
